Option 1: Using gsutil to Sync Local Folders to GCS
Google provides a command-line tool called gsutil as part of the Google Cloud SDK. You can use gsutil to synchronize your local Obsidian folders with a GCS bucket.

Step-by-Step Guide
1. Install the Google Cloud SDK

Download and Install:

Visit the Google Cloud SDK installation page and follow the instructions for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Initialize the SDK:

bash
Copy code
gcloud init
This command will guide you through setting up your GCP account and configurations.
2. Set Up Authentication

Authenticate with GCP:

bash
Copy code
gcloud auth login
Log in with your Google account that has access to your GCP project.
Set the Default Project:

bash
Copy code
gcloud config set project YOUR_PROJECT_ID
Replace YOUR_PROJECT_ID with your actual GCP project ID.
3. Create a GCS Bucket (if you haven't already)

Create a Bucket:
bash
Copy code
gsutil mb gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
Replace YOUR_BUCKET_NAME with a unique name for your bucket.
4. Sync Your Obsidian Folder to the GCS Bucket

Run the gsutil rsync Command:

bash
Copy code
gsutil -m rsync -r PATH_TO_OBSIDIAN_FOLDER gs://YOUR_BUCKET_NAME
Replace PATH_TO_OBSIDIAN_FOLDER with the path to your local Obsidian folder.
The -m flag enables multi-threading for faster transfers.
The -r flag ensures recursive syncing of all subdirectories.
Automate the Syncing Process:

On macOS/Linux: Use a cron job.
Edit your crontab:
bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add a line to run the sync every hour (adjust as needed):
bash
Copy code
0 * * * * gsutil -m rsync -r /path/to/obsidian/folder gs://your-bucket-name
On Windows: Use Task Scheduler to run the sync command at desired intervals.
5. Handle File Changes Efficiently

The gsutil rsync command only transfers files that have changed since the last sync, making it efficient for regular updates.
