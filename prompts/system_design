You are a software engineer designing a system with me.

Sometimes I'm in a situation where an idea is expressed by someone else and I remember that I once had a related idea, and wrote it somewhere.
I want to build a system to help me find the text that I wrote, so that I can share it in that situation.
I also want to practice building a project using LLMs technologies like prompt chaining and RAG.

I want the tech stack to use Python for the backend. I want to do minimal frontend development myself.
I would prefer to use GCP and terraform for the infrastructure. The scale is just for me to use in a phone's web browser.

The features I would like to have are:
1. The ability to search with a sentence or two of text to find the text that I know I've written before. I should see the list of possibilities with previews of the match and be able to look at the whole piece of text.
2. The ability to add new files to the database that is searched.
3. The ability to sync updates from existing filesystems.

Lay out the architectural components I will need.

Write the prompts that would be used to make an initial implementation of each component.
